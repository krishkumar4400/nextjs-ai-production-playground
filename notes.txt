Next.Js:
Getting Started & Fundamentals of nextjs

*** What is nextjs and why frameworks are reccomended ?

1. production ready react framework built by vercel that provides additional structures
2. 

in react we need to handle everything manually
    eg: routing - react-router-dom

problems in react:
    1. no built in routing
    2. no seo optimization
    3. no server side rendering 
    4. no built in performance
    5. no api routes (custom backend)
    6. manual code spilliting

Nexts.js provieds a lot of things out of the box:
    1. server side rendering (SSR)
    2. File based routing
    3. built in performance optimization
